Overview
This repository contains a series of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects using diverse datasets from various industries such as e-commerce, food delivery, and air travel. Each project focuses on uncovering insights, trends, and relationships within the data to inform business decisions and improve predictive modeling. The datasets include Customer Churn, Black Friday Deals, Zomato Restaurant Data, and Flight Price Prediction.

Projects
